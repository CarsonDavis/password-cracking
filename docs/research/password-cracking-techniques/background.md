### Search: "hashcat attack modes comprehensive guide brute force dictionary mask hybrid 2025 2026"

- **Hashcat attack mode 0 (Dictionary/Straight):** Each word in a wordlist is hashed and compared with the target. This is the simplest mode. ([StationX][3])
- **Hashcat attack mode 3 (Brute Force/Mask):** Tries every possible character combination in the 95 printable ASCII range. A mask attack is a refined form of brute force where known patterns reduce the keyspace. For example, `?l?l?d?d` tests two lowercase + two digits. ([In.Security][1])
- **Hashcat attack modes 6 & 7 (Hybrid):** Combine a dictionary with brute force. Mode 6 appends brute-force characters to dictionary words; mode 7 prepends them. The full brute-force keyspace is applied to each dictionary entry. ([Hashcat Wiki][2])
- **Mask attack charset markers:** `?l` = lowercase, `?u` = uppercase, `?d` = digits, `?s` = special chars, `?a` = all printable ASCII. Custom charsets can be defined. ([In.Security][1])

**Follow-up questions:** What are the specific throughput numbers for modern GPUs? How does hashcat handle rule-based attacks (mode 0 + rules)?
